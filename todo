Make timeout an overridable config within the scripts config

Make some working default scripts (have them optionally read in config, something like, enable demo scritps or something, off by default i think is best)


Log support - Count (number of runs), age (by days), and size (mb)?

make better deployment section for scheduling documentation

automate cron and systemd configs
    - workflow = Generates configs, user can review them and choose not to install them or install them 
    -Function to generate configs and save them 
        - prompts user to look at them or to just install them (possible dry-run mode sort of implementation?)
    -Function to automatically install cron or systemd (give a choice or preference?)
        - can be called directly from the script if a user selects y, or can be called directly from a script --argument 
    



include config check documentation


parse output feature? maybe using something like awk?
    - additional notify catch? 
        - Example, harddrive usage script. Currently signal box just runs and doesn't care what about put is as long as the script ran. Could have a optional parse output. Then send to notification if x>90 or something?
        - Maybe the concept a second validation gate, ie -> script ran successfully -> parse output -> if this, then green -> if this than yellow -> if this than red. 
    or maybe just pass parse output to signalbox notify or something



Signalbox Alerts: 
- New CLI command: `signalbox alerts` lists recent alerts triggered by scripts.
- Implementation steps:
  - Parse script logs/output for alert patterns defined in YAML config.
  - Support multiple alert patterns per script (alerts: list).
  - Store alerts with script name, message, timestamp, and status.
  - Display alert summary in CLI; allow filtering by time/severity.
- Consider storing alerts in a dedicated log or database for efficient querying.
- Design extensible pattern matching for future alert types.
