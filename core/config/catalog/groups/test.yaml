# Error Handling Test Groups
#
# ⚠️  IMPORTANT: These are EXAMPLE groups for learning and getting started.
# These scripts are NOT meant for production use - they are educational tools!
#
#
# This file demonstrates error handling behavior using the fail_test script.
# These groups are specifically for learning and testing purposes:
#
# - test_serial_fail: Uses stop_on_error=true
#   Result: When fail_test fails, show_date will NOT run (execution stops)
#
# - test_serial_continue: Uses stop_on_error=false  
#   Result: When fail_test fails, show_date will STILL run (execution continues)
#
# Run these groups to see the difference in behavior!
# The fail_test script is INTENTIONALLY designed to fail for demonstration.

groups:
- name: test_serial_fail
  description: Test serial with failure (DEMO - execution stops on error)
  execution: serial
  stop_on_error: true  # STOPS when fail_test fails
  scripts:
  - hello       # (check) Runs and succeeds
  - fail_test   # (X) FAILS intentionally and STOPS execution here
  - show_date   # (pause) Will NOT run (execution stopped)

- name: test_serial_continue
  description: Test serial continue on error (DEMO - execution continues despite errors)
  execution: serial
  stop_on_error: false  # CONTINUES even when fail_test fails
  scripts:
  - hello       # (check) Runs and succeeds
  - fail_test   # (X) FAILS intentionally but execution continues
  - show_date   # (check) Still runs despite previous failure
