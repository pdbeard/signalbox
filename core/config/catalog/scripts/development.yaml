# Development Workflow Example Scripts
#
# ⚠️  IMPORTANT: These are EXAMPLE scripts for learning and getting started.
# These scripts are NOT meant for production use - they are educational tools!
#
#
# NOTE: All commands use 'echo' and 'sleep' for demonstration purposes.
# In real usage, replace these with actual build tools, test runners, 
# deployment scripts, etc. (e.g., pytest, npm test, docker build, kubectl apply)
