# Web Monitoring Example Scripts
#
# ⚠️  IMPORTANT: These are EXAMPLE scripts for learning and getting started.
# These scripts are NOT meant for production use - they are educational tools!
#
# This file demonstrates web service monitoring capabilities using signalbox.
# These scripts show how to:
# - Check website availability and health
# - Monitor API response times and functionality
# - Validate SSL certificates and security
# - Test DNS resolution and network connectivity
#
# All scripts use httpbin.org as a test service (safe for examples)
# Modify the URLs and endpoints for your actual services.
