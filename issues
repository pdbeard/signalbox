seems to have permission errors when attempting log rotation

Tray pulls from runtime, runtime doesn't change or update on config changes, so stays red if you delete old scripts that never run successfully. 

Probably need a clear all runtime, or some sort of history where it doesn't count as "unsuccesful" to the signalbox-tray. 

Init carrys over runtimes

init still created a script folder in catalog. 

Config is not pulling from ~/.config/signalbox/config only from signalbox/config/catalog (think if fixed this already on another computer but didn't push to github)


had installing via pipx had to uninstall via pipx and then install to fix the issue (should include in readme)
