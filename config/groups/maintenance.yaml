# Maintenance and Demo Groups Examples
#
# ⚠️  IMPORTANT: These are EXAMPLE groups for learning and getting started.
# These scripts are NOT meant for production use - they are educational tools!
#
# This file shows various execution patterns and error handling strategies:
#
#
# NOTE: The 'fail_test' script is INTENTIONALLY designed to fail (exit 1)
# to demonstrate error handling - this is not a bug!

  description: Demonstrate serial execution with stop-on-error
  execution: serial
  stop_on_error: true  # ← STOPS execution when fail_test fails
  scripts:
  - check_website_health  # ✓ This will succeed
  - fail_test             # ✗ This will FAIL (intentionally) and STOP here
  - check_memory_usage    # ⏸ This will NOT run (execution stopped)
  - check_disk_space      # ⏸ This will NOT run (execution stopped)
  # DEMO PURPOSE: Run this to see stop_on_error=true behavior

- name: error_handling_demo_continue
  description: Demonstrate serial execution continuing on errors
  execution: serial
  stop_on_error: false  # ← CONTINUES execution even when fail_test fails
  scripts:
  - check_website_health  # ✓ This will succeed
  - fail_test             # ✗ This will FAIL (intentionally) but execution continues
  - check_memory_usage    # ✓ This will still run despite previous failure
  - check_disk_space      # ✓ This will also run
  # DEMO PURPOSE: Run this to see stop_on_error=false behavior
