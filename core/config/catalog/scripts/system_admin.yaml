# System Administration Example Scripts
#
# ⚠️  IMPORTANT: These are EXAMPLE scripts for learning and getting started.
# These scripts are NOT meant for production use - they are educational tools!
#
# This file demonstrates system monitoring and maintenance scripts.
# These scripts show real system administration tasks:
# - Monitoring disk space, memory, and system load with thresholds
# - Checking critical services and network connectivity  
# - Security updates and system maintenance
# - Configuration backup and cleanup operations
#
# NOTE: These scripts include actual system commands (df, free, ps, etc.)
# They will work on most Unix-like systems but may need adjustment for
# your specific environment. The scripts include fallbacks for macOS compatibility.
